PROBLEM:

A company has several employees at different grades(senior, junior, trainee, etc.), it is a hectic task to assign work to all of them as per their roles, grades and work capacity without biasing.

Various things are given to us:
->Grade of the employee
->Sources(Employee id)
->Maximum Workload of each employee based on the grade
->Remaining workload
->Task load
->Task credits
->Task deadline
->N(No. of grades in a company)(vary company to company)
-Grades categorization in upper, mid and lower grade.
->A predefined list of tasks with it's load, tag  and credits(vary company to company)

Conditions:
->The credits of the work should be distributed among the sources according to their grades.(Higher grade will have higher credit share than the below grade sources).
->Each grade will be having the same maximum work load capacity irrespective of their roles.
->The workload of the source should be retarded instantly when work is assigned to it.
->The grades will be categorized into upper, mid and lower. This categorization will be predefined.
->The task is divided into three tags-Basic, Intermediate and Advanced. Each task will be assigned with a tag out of these three.
->Basic tag task can only be done by lower grade sources, intermediate by mid grade and advanced by upper grades.
->A minimum criteria will be defined for each task tag i.e. minimum no. of sources will be set for each tag.
->The sources having mismatched roles to task role/category(selected from the list) will be eliminated with the work assigning process of that particular work).
->The work should be distributed on the priority basis, the source holding less work in accordance with it's capacity will be served first.
->Every task will be having a deadline, and each day after deadline cost sources 1 credit each involved in the task.

Expected Cases:
->If the task load is greater than all the remaining workload of the sources than the work can be extended to the overtime sources and each involved source will get 10% extra credits of the total credits assign to that work irrespective of their grade. The overtime work assigning process will be same as normal.
->If any of the employees having same remaining workload capacity then priority of serving work will be greater for lower grade.(In case of same grade, random source can be selected)

We have to program an efficient system that enables the company to distribute work to it's employee without biasing and following all the above conditions.


Random case:

Task credits: 80
Task load:100
Task tag: Basic
Task deadline:15 days on after task is assigned
Total grades of company:9
Grade category distribution:
Lower:1-3
Mid:4-6
Upper: above 6

Assuming all have preferred job role for the specified task.

Grade			7		4		1		5
Grade level		Upper 		Mid		Lower		Mid
Sources			A		B		C		D
Max. workload		60		100		150		90
Workload remaining	20		50		80		50
Free workload		0.33		0.50		0.54		0.55
Priority		Eliminated	II		Eliminated	I

Here Source D and B should get the work.
